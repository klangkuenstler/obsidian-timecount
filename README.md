# Timecount

Timecount is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin that aims to store and let you view the time spent in the program.



## Development acknowledgements

1. This plugin is not fully developed yet, therefore there is no warrantty that it will work propperly;
2. This project is, developed for fun only by me, and I don't intend to make it really good, neither user focused. Instead, it's only purpose is to expand my own practic development knowledge by developing my first Obsidian plugin.

With this in mind, don't expect much. 


## Issues and pull requests

As mentioned in the previous section, this is nothing but a side fun project.
Anyways, **issues and/or pull requests are welcome!**
